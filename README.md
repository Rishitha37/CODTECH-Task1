### Project Name : Todo List

This project is a simple Todo List web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can add, filter, and track the progress of their tasks.

#### Key Features:

1. **Task Addition**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list by typing in a text input and clicking the "Add Task" button. Each task can be customized with descriptions of what needs to be done.

2. **Task Filtering**: Users can filter the tasks displayed on the page based on their status:
   
    - **All**: Shows all tasks, regardless of their status.
    - **Active**: Displays only tasks that have not yet been marked as completed.
    - **Completed**: Displays only tasks that are marked as completed.

3. **Progress Tracking**: A dynamic progress bar and statistics are provided to visualize task completion. As tasks are marked complete, the progress bar fills up and the stats update accordingly, reflecting the percentage of completed tasks.
